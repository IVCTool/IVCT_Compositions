# About the IVCT

The Integration, Verification and Certification Tool (IVCT) is a tool that facilitates the testing of a simulation system, a so called System under Test (SuT). The IVCT provides a software framework for the implementation and execution of test cases to verify the compliance of a SuT against interoperability requirements.

The IVCT consists of several components and provides a web-based graphical user interface to define a SuT,  view available test cases, initiation a test, and view test results. 

## IVCT deployment and operation

The IVCT is provided in the form of container images that can be deployed with a singe **Docker compose file**. This repository contains several Docker compose files for deploying the IVCT in different modes and configurations, depending on the needs and requirements of the local environment.

Further information about the IVCT deployment and operation can be found in the [documentation](docs/src/home.adoc) section of this repository.

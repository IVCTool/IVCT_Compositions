= Explore the Grapical User Interface

== Introduction

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a webbrowser based application. You need to open your preferred HTML browser and navigate to the IVCT home page. In a local and standard deployment, this would typically be:

  http:/localhost:8080

In the standard deployment, the first page will be the login screen. Only authorized users are allowed to use the IVCT. With an initial deployment the default user name and password is `admin` and `admin`.

After a successful login the IVCT UI will be started. The general layout concept consists of a menu bar on the top part of the page, a navigation frame on the left side with a blue background, and content frame on the right side with a white background.

The Navigation frame has three parts, selectable via the little ‘^’ in the top left corner. The first one is the so called “Badges” view, the second one is the “Testsuites” view, and the third one is the “System under Test” view. These views are described below in more detail.

== The Badge View

In the badge view, all installed compliance badges are shown. While no badge is selected in the navigation frame, the content frame shows the same overview list in an iconic layout.

image:images/GUI_BadgeView.PNG[Badge View]

When a badge is selected in the navigation frame, the details will be shown in the content frame. These general information like the name, the version, a short description and a visual key representing the badge.
A badge also contains interoperability requirements, either directly assigned to the badge, or indirectly by a dependency definition to another badge. These interoperability requirements are assigned to test cases, which need to be passed in order to be considered compliant to that badge.

== The TestSuite View

The test suite view shows all included test suites in the IVCT platform.

image:images/GUI_TestsuitesView.PNG[TS View]

When you select an test suite definition, additional information such as name, version, description and assigned test cases are displayed.
If you select a special test case, the assigned interoperability requirements are displayed.

== The SuT View

The System under Test (SuT) view, shows the configure systems to be tested. New systems for testing can be added with the menu <SUT Settings - New SuT> and existing configurations can be edited, after selecting them. The selection of a SuT shows the details view for that system under test.

image:images/GUI_SutView.PNG[SuT View]

The details view shows general information about the system under test, such as its name, vender and version, a short description of its purpose, as well as information for the IVCT on how to connect to the `HLA RTI`. This connection information is called the `Local Settings Designator` (LSD) and the value is passed as-is to the `RTI Connection` call. For more information about the LSD, see <<IVCT-Local-Settings-Designator#,The Local Settings Designator>>. Furthermore, the federate name and the federation name can be specified.

Below the general information the capability status shows the selected capabilities with the badge id, the badge name and a conformance status after testing all interoperability requirements from the selected badge.

If the selected SuT has already been tested, the test reports will be listed below the capability status. A report can be inspected by a double-click. This will open a new tab in the content frame with a text view. You can close this tab with the close button in the menu, or you leave it open for later use.

When selecting a SuT in the navigation frame, the underlying badges are shown.
These are the badges which are named in the conformance statement when creating a SuT description.
Selecting a badge will show all contained test suites.

Selecting a test suite will show the included test case tiles and the details to be used for testing.
These are test case parameters, optionally some extra parameters as required by some test cases.

image:images/GUI_SutHwEncoding.PNG[SuT View]

When selecting a test case tile the list of interoperability requirements are shown in the requirement table.

Depending on the status of the test execution, the test case tiles are displayed in different colors:

- **PASSED**: green color
- **INCONCLUSIVE**: purple colors
- **FAILED**: red color

image:images/GUI_SutHwEncodingTC.PNG[SuT View]

In order to test a test case, it must be selected in the navigation frame (double click on the test case tile).
That opens a detail view in the content frame, with a short description and a list of reports with existing protocol files.
With the button <TC execute> in the menu frame, the test case assigned to this interoperability requirement can be started.

Depending on the status of the test execution, the test result name in <TC Status> and <TC Execution History> are displayed in different colors:

- **PASSED**: green color
- **INCONCLUSIVE**: purple colors
- **FAILED**: red color

The <TC Execution Log> table displays the log message selected in the <TC Execution History> table.
Log messages with the log level error are colored red.
Log messages with the log level warning colored yellow.

image:images/GUI_TcExecHistory.PNG[SuT View]

After the start of a test case, the current status of the running test case is displayed in a progress bar.
The messages in the status table are created by the test case and will give insights on the current test activity.
A detailed protocol log shows the current output of the running test case.

image:images/GUI_TcExec.PNG[SuT View]

Some testcases require a dynamic reaction from the SuT which cannot be automated.
The test case makes a request to the SuT operator and waits until the SuT operator confirms that the required action or configuration has been performed.
An optional comment for traceability can be added.

At the end of the execution of a test case, the status of the test execution is displayed in form of a popup window.

== SuT Creation and Editing

The creation and editing of SuTs is possible via the menu item <SuT Settings>.

When creating and editing SuTs, the descriptions are opened in an editing tab.
In the edit mode you can change the Name, Vendor, Version, RTI Connection, Federate Name, Federation Name and the Description of the SuT.

An important part is the definition of the SuT capabilities.
**The selection of the available badges, is considered as the conformance statement of the SuT.**
This selection will define the interoperability requirements to be used for the compliance testing.

== Additional information

=== Language and Log Level Settings

The system allows the user to change of the language settings and log level settings.

You can select either English or German as language. The default language is English.

As log level you can decide between the following levels:

- TRACE
- DEBUG
- INFO
- WARN
- ERROR

The default log level is INFO.

=== TestEngine and LogSink Status

The TestEngine and LogSink status is shown in the user interface.
The status display shows whether the components are currently available and reports if they are no longer accessible.

With a green status display the components are available.

image:images/GUI_TestEngineStatusGreen.PNG[TestEngine Status]

With a yellow status display the components are currently not available.

image:images/GUI_TestEngineStatusYellow.PNG[TestEngine Status]

With a red status display the components are not available.

=== IVCT Version and Logout

System information, such as the software version of the IVCT environment, can be displayed via the menu item <About>.
The menu item <Logout> logs the user off the system.

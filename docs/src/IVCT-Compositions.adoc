= IVCT Compositions

Supported IVCT Compositions are available from the Compositions repository. The structure of the repository looks like:

....

Compositions
 |-- ivct-pitch                 (IVCT compositions for the Pitch RTI)
 |    |-- host-mode
 |    |-- overlay-mode
 |
 |-- ivct-portico               (IVCT compositions for the Portico RTI)
 |    |-- host-mode
 |
 |-- ivct-vtmak                 (IVCT compositions for the VTMaK RTI)
 |    |-- host-mode
 |    |-- overlay-mode
 |
....

For some of compositions there is an `.env` file with environment variables that may need to be adapted to suit the local environment. If there is no `.env` file, then the composition can be used as is.

As noted in <<IVCT-Deployment-Options.adoc#,Deployment options>>, the host mode compositions require a Linux host.

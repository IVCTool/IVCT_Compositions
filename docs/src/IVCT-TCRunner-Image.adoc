== IVCT TC Runner Application image

The Test Case (TC) Runner Application executes test cases. The TC Runner Application image is based on a Local RTI Component (LRC) Base image.

The LRC Base image is a minimal image and provides basic functionality to launch an HLA federate application. Several LRC Base images are available for different RTI implementations (Pitch, Mak, Portico) and Linux distributions (Alpine, Debian, CentOS). Each LRC Base image includes a Java JRE and provides several environment variables to control the behavior or some settings of the LRC. The LRC Base image settings are overridden by the settings provided via the Local Settings Designator.

At run-time, Test Case execution results are reported via the Active MQ.

=== Environment Variables

|===
| Environment Variable Name   | Description | Default if not set

| ``ACTIVEMQ_HOST``           | Hostname/IP of the Active MQ host | `localhost`
| ``ACTIVEMQ_PORT``           | Port at which Active MQ can be reached at the host | `61616`
| ``IVCT_CONF``               | References either a directory with the properties file named `IVCT.properties` or to the properties file itself. | `/root/conf`
|===

Additional environment variables are inherited from the LRC image. The most relevant ones are listed below.

==== Pitch LRC settings
|===
| Environment variable        | Description | Default if not set

| ``PITCH_LRCADAPTER``        | Applies to direct mode. The network adapter that the LRC should use. | Use IP route to CRC to determine adapter
| ``PITCH_CRCADDRESS``        | CRC address in the format of `<host>:<port>` (direct mode) or `<crc-nickname>@<boost host>:<boost port>` (booster mode). | `crc:8989`
| ``PITCH_ADVERTISE_ADDRESS`` | Applies to direct mode. Use this address to advertise the LRC. The format is ``[<host address>][:[<mintcpport>]-[<maxtcpport>][:[<minudpport>]-[<maxudpport>]]]`` | Mode IP, ``:6000-6999:5000-5999``
|===

==== Portico LRC settings
|===
| Environment variable        | Description | Default if not set

| ``PORTICO_LRCADAPTER``      | The network adapter (network interface) that the LRC should use. The name must be an exact match. | RID file default
|===

==== VTMaK LRC settings

|===
| Environment variable        | Description | Default if not set

| ``MAK_LRCADAPTER``          | Network interface address to use for the MaK Forwarder | `0.0.0.0`, i.e. first available non-localhost interface address
| ``MAK_RTIEXECADDRESS``      | RTI Exec address in the format of `<host>:<port>`. | `rtiexec:4000`

= IVCT Deployment and Operation

== Introduction

The primary deployment model of the IVCT is based on Docker container technology. https://docker.com[Docker] is an open source product that supports the creation, management and deployment of containers. The main benefit of using Docker container technology is that containers are portable and include all software dependencies, independent of the host operating system version on which the container executes. Containers can be transferred almost seamlessly between Docker container execution environments.

Containers provides an easy way to distribute and deploy the IVCT on different platforms for different HLA Evolved (IEEE 1516-2010) RTI implementations. The application of Docker container technology allows a user to run the IVCT without having to build and install the IVCT Framework and its dependencies. All that is required is a functional Docker Engine installed on a host. See https://docs.docker.com/install[Docker Engine] for instructions on installing a Docker Engine.

IVCT Docker container images are available from the https://hub.docker.com/u/ivct[Docker Hub], the main distribution medium for Docker container images. Currently, the following RTI implementations are supported by the IVCT:

- `Pitch RTI` (http://pitchtechnologies.com)
- `VTMaK RTI` (https://www.mak.com)
- `Portico` (https://github.com/openlvc/portico)

The remainder of this page lists several topics related to IVCT deployment and operation, with links to further information in the documentation section. This includes getting started instructions and information with regards to different IVCT deployment and configuration options.

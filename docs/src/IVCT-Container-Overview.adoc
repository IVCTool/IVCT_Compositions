= IVCT Container Overview

The IVCT consists of several Docker container images. An overview of the container images and the relationships between them is provided in the following figure.

The color coding of the images is:

- **BLUE**: IVCT container images (i.e. <<IVCT-TCRunner-Image#,IVCT TC Runner image>>, <<IVCT-GUI-Image#,IVCT GUI image>>, and <<IVCT-LogSink-Image#,IVCT LogSink image>>).
- **GREY**: IVCT data volumes (as container image or other storage class), see <<IVCT-TestSuite-Images#,Test Suites overview>>.
- **WHITE**: These are outside the scope of the IVCT project. E.g. the HLA RTI related container images.

The relationships are:

- **links**: container image establishes network connection to other container image at run-time.
- **extends**: container image is based on the other container image (see Dockerfile `FROM` instruction).
- **mounts**: container image mounts the indicated data volume at run-time.

The TestSuite data volume is mounted by the IVCT GUI and IVCT TC Runner Application.
The RunTime Config data volume is mounted by every IVCT container. In addition, this data volume includes the test results.

The RTI specific images and the LRC Base image are described in detail at  https://github.com/hlacontainers.

The IVCT TC Runner Application image inherits several environment variables from the LRC Base image. For more information about this, see the image description.

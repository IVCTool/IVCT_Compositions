= Updating Test Suite images

In case another version of a Test Suite container image needs to be used, two steps need to be performed:

* Update the applicable IVCT docker compose file to refer to the new Test Suite image, and
* Execute the command `docker volume prune` to remove the volume associated with the old Test Suite container image.

For the last step ensure that any container (i.e. not container image) that uses the volume provided by the old Test Suite container image has been stopped and removed.
